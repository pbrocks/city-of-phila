# WPE Code Sample

We'd like you to come up with solutions to a couple of user stories that are similar to the work we do every day. Given each of the scenarios below, develop a solution that is simple, scalable, and easily maintainable. Leverage core WordPress features when appropriate. And pull in libraries if needed (and only if needed).

1. Marketing team members are having a hard time figuring out what page templates are being used on what pages. Write a plugin that lets authors easily see which template a page is using and also see only pages using a particular template.

2. The stakeholders want to be able to get featured posts out of many of our blogs and online magazines so they can put the posts into a widget on the wpengine.com blog. Write a plugin for those WordPress sites that gives the post author a way to mark a post as "Featured on WP Engine's blog" and a way to get the 5 most recent featured posts out of the REST API.
