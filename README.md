### What you’ll be creating

Often, we need to accommodate requests from users for a new field, or new section in the WordPress admin interface, with a corresponding rendering on the front-end. 

Your task is to create a set of fields in the WordPress admin that allows a user to add the following to the e _**posts**_ post type in WordPress:

  - A date field to select the “release date” of the post
  - A set of repeatable text fields for: 
  	- Contact name
  	- Contact email address
  	- Contact phone number

These fields should be rendered on the front-end under the post title (see the highlighted area of the next slide for an example). You can modify the WordPress default Twenty Nineteen (or Twenty Twenty) theme. 

### Requirements

Use the Meta Box plugin to make the fields in the admin. You can use fieldset text for the fields that need to be repeatable. 

  - The user should be able to create any number of contact fields.
  - The contact name should be a link to a website.
  - The release date should be formatted like the following: June 29, 2019
  - If the release date or a piece of content isn’t entered, the field should not appear on the front-end.
